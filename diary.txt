TODO
 - print / read new papers
 - see what happens with numpy bfgs minimiser when linesearch is removed

 ----------

  - Why do they use a runge kutta method to solve the equations when all they 
    want to do is minimise withing a trust region?
  - Is it because it becomes tricky when you have a multidimentional function?

----------

 - string starts going crazy after a few macro iterations.
 - could be because the hessian is getting confused after it gets updated 
   based on gradient from re-spaced points.
 - will the methods described in the paper fix this?
 - *** mostly fixed by makign trust radius better
 - *** remaining problem seems to be that some points move far slower than 
   others, causing kinks in the string

 - above problem fixed by using adaptive step sizes

Tasks / wish list
----------
 - implement final parts of QSM
 - investigate OpenBabel and cclib (DONE)
 - implement calc queueing, remembering and multithreading (DONE)
 - improve logging / error reporting (DONE for sched.py)
 - get code to use new scheduler (DONE - need to test)
 - test NEB again (DONE)
 - compare SciPy BFGS optimiser with mine
 - test growing string with QSM (DONE)
 - implement test for oscillating string/band
 - test on other potentials
 - uniform interface for searchers

----------
 - need to implement: mol_interface.get_reagent_coords()
 - also convert relevant functions in mol_interface to operate on an arbitrary list of input molecules
