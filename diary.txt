  - Why do they use a runge kutta method to solve the equations when all they 
    want to do is minimise withing a trust region?
  - Is it because it becomes tricky when you have a multidimentional function?

 - string starts going crazy after a few macro iterations.
 - could be because the hessian is getting confused after it gets updated 
   based on gradient from re-spaced points.
 - will the methods described in the paper fix this?
 - *** mostly fixed by makign trust radius better
 - *** remaining problem seems to be that some points move far slower than others, causing kinks in the string
